REQUIREMENTS:
    - ant           (no version requirements?)
    - java 1.6	    (currently works with both Sun's JDK; 
                     and OpenJDK)

BUILD:
    - run `make` (or `ant` : Makefile is just a wrapper)

INSTALL:
    - make install

    This puts scripts and jars into a specified $prefix

CONFIG:
    Build a default configuration with:
    fvconfig generate config.json

    Load the contents of the config.json in to database:
    fvconfig load config.json

    Dump the running config to a file:
    fvctl dumpConfig <filename>

    The config file is editable manually. Once editted, you may
    load the file using the above command (recommended) or start
    flowvisor with the config file as a parameter.

    You can still configure flowvisor during runtime using fvctl.
        `man 1 fvctl` or `man ./doc/fvctl.1` for details
